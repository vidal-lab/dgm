Late Homework Policy. 
Each student will be given three (3) late days in total for this course. You can freely arrange them across all homework. For example, you can use two days for HW1, one day for HW2, and you will have to submit HW3 exactly on time. Another example is that, if you submit HW1 and HW2 on time, you will have three days for HW3.
